  description: Charalampos (Babis) Pappas is a junior group leader the Cluster of Excellence Living, Adaptive and Energy-autonomous Materials Systems (livMatS) at the University of Freiburg. His group focuses on systems chemistry approaches towards the discovery of life-like peptide matter. Babis received his Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Chemistry from the University of Ioannina. In 2016, he received his Ph.D. degree entitled ”Supramolecular Systems Chemistry using Peptides” from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow working in the group of Prof. Rein Ulijn. After a short 6-month postdoctoral stay at the City University of New York, in 2017 he received a Marie Curie Fellowship and moved to the University of Groningen, where he worked with Prof. Sijbren Otto on dynamic folded macromolecules.

  description: Nina Hartrampf is an Assistant Professor (tenure track) for “Next Generation Synthesis” at the University of Zurich. Her group’s current research interests are the development of new flow-based methods for peptide synthesis and modification, and their application to the investigation of post-translationally modified peptides and proteins. She received a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry and Biochemistry as well as a Master’s degree in Chemistry from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. In 2013, she joined the group of Prof. Dr. Dirk Trauner for her graduate studies in natural product synthesis. After graduating summa cum laude in 2017, she joined the group of Prof. Bradley L. Pentelute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her postdoctoral work focused on the rapid high-fidelity synthesis of peptides and proteins using automated flow chemistry.
