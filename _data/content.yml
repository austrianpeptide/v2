    s and Master\u2019s degree in Chemistry from the University of Ioannina. In 2016,\
    \ he received his Ph.D. degree entitled \u201DSupramolecular Systems Chemistry\
    \ using Peptides\u201D from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow working in\
    \ the group of Prof. Rein Ulijn. After a short 6-month postdoctoral stay at the\
    \ City University of New York, in 2017 he received a Marie Curie Fellowship and\
    \ moved to the University of Groningen, where he worked with Prof. Sijbren Otto\
    \ on dynamic folded macromolecules."
