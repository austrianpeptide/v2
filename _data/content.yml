  description: "Dr. Peter \u2018t Hart is a group leader at the Chemical Genomics\
    \ Centre at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology in Dortmund. In his\
    \ research he uses macrocyclic peptides to inhibit challenging targets such as\
    \ protein-protein interaction with a current focus on protein-RNA interactions.\
    \ His team uses both structure-based design as well as genetically encoded library\
    \ screening techniques to identify such inhibitors and various biochemical and\
    \ cellular techniques to investigate their effects. Furthermore, the group also\
    \ works on developing new late-stage functionalization techniques for the introduction\
    \ of unnatural amino acids during solid phase peptide synthesis as well as methods\
    \ to improve peptide cell permeability. He got his bachelor's degree from the\
    \ Rotterdam University of Applied Science in chemistry and his Master\u2019s degree\
    \ from Utrecht University in Pharmacy. For his PhD he stayed at Utrecht University\
    \ in the Medicinal Chemistry and Chemical Biology group with prof. dr. Nathaniel\
    \ Martin working the identification of antibiotic bicyclic peptides using phage\
    \ display. Then he moved to the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology for\
    \ a postdoctoral position as a Humboldt Research Fellow in the group of prof.\
    \ dr. Herbert Waldmann. Here he worked on the structure-based design of cyclic\
    \ peptide inhibitors of epigenetic regulator proteins. "

    \ the group of Prof. Rein Ulijn. After a short 6-month postdoctoral stay at the\
    \ City University of New York, in 2017 he received a Marie Curie Fellowship and\
    \ moved to the University of Groningen, where he worked with Prof. Sijbren Otto\
    \ on dynamic folded macromolecules."
